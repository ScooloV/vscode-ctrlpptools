## Features

### Syntax highlighter

Fully integrated syntax highlighter for CTRL language.
* All basic CTRL key words
* All basic CTRL variable types
* CTRL and CTRL++ support

### Quality Checks

A collection of various Code Quality checks that are easy to use.

With the SloopTools Quality Checks, we want to improve the Code Quality of WinCC OA* projects and offer a comprehensive service.

#### CtrlPPCheck

The static code analysis tool **CtrlPPCheck** is a variation of the well-known cppCheck that understands WinCC OA* CTRL and CTRL++.

Included are, among many others, these checks:
* Undefined variables
* Unused variables
* Unused functions
* Dead code
* Comparison is always true / false
* Return value of a specific function is not used
  e.g. return from dpExists ()
* and other ...

CtrlPPCheck has configured all known CTRL functions and constants.
Note: The configuration was carried out with the WinCC OA* version 3.16 P12. If you have any problems, please let us know and create an [issue](https://github.com/LukasSchopp/vscode-ctrlpptools/issues/new/choose).

FREE version of CtrlPPCheck included in DEMO version!
